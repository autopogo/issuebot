// TODO: Refactor this todo list
// TODO: Issue log would be cool on custom response to log channel
// TODO: It would be cool if you could use a particular user's github credentials from slack but that's a part of a custom auth feature
// TODO: Could use oauth but oauth reg on github was requiring a larger-scoped registration process (website, etc)- the super benefit of this is that it restrict users to repos they have access to, which would eliminate some of the problems with github's over-scoped token situation (below). This would also allow us to use the suggest log channel as a way to communicate with issues.
// TODO: the above would change the keyword too
// TODO: unfortunately, github scopes are _not_ granular. for issues, you get +rw on code, pull reqs, wikis, settings, webhooks, deploy keys. this is a 2yr mega thread on github.com/dear-githu[M#Ãˆb
// TODO: one way to turn this into an interface would be to create a new bot type that could be initialized with a slack org(s) and github org(s) but I feel like it would just be better to run seperate processes -- although multiple slack orgs and github orgs would be good (although multiple github orgs if users supply their own keys too)
// TODO: needs timeout on network ops
