# issuebot

**issuebot** is a slackbot that allows creating new github issues with a command.

NB: It runs under a single user, and you can only have it write to one organization at this time.

## Building

There is a list of dependencies below- you can use your own dep manager or just use `go get`

This project now has files necessary to use **godep** if you want to vendor the dependencies.

_Hint: `git clone` this repo to your `$GOPATH/src` directory; `go help gopath` and `go help importpath` for more info_

### Make commands (more in _Makefile_): 

`make build`  
Outputs binary to _./build/_. This is the default make target.

`make test`  
Runs `go test` as expected

### Dependencies

#### Run

[github.com/ayjayt/slacker](https://github.com/shomali11/slacker)  
A simple library that allows you to create slackbots by registering a command string and a callback
Note: A simple fixed has been suggested to shomali11- the original author: https://github.com/shomali11/slacker/issues/33

[github.com/shurcooL/githubv4](https://github.com/shomali11/slacker)  
An extensive library that creates a go interface for the GitHub APIv4 (GraphQL)

[golang.org/x/oauth2](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/oauth2)  
The oauth library used by GitHub APIv4 for auth

[github.com/mailgun/log](https://github.com/mailgun/log)  
The logger used by this programmer

[github.com/gravitational/trace](https://github.com/gravitational/trace)  
Used to enhance error handling

#### Test

[gopkg.in/check.v1](https://gopkg.in/check.v1)  
A testing suite to enhance Go's native "testing" module

## After Building: Configure and Run

1. Create a slack token (refer to slack docs)
2. Create a github token (refer to github docs)  
_NB: as of Feb 2019, this can be the personal or the "oauth"- effectively the same (oath), but "oath" registers your "app"_
3. Create a file and list slack users (by user ID, not by user name)- each on a new line, who can use the issuebot. The default file name is *./userlist* but can be overrided by a flag.
4. Run the program (see below for typical use or use `issuebot --help` to see all flags) in _./build/_ and it will do it's best to connect:
  * You must specify `--org "org name or user name"` so that IssueBot knows where to find repos specified by the user.
  * You must specify slack and github tokens with `--slack_token` and `--github_token`

### Example in CLI:

```
$: ./issuebot --org=gravitational --auth=./userlist --slack-token=SLACK_TOKEN --github-token=GITHUB_TOKEN
...logging
```
## Using with Slack

Mention or direct message the issuebot by name with: `new "REPO_NAME" "ISSUE_TITLE" "ISSUE_BODY"`

Quotes are required. You can escape quotes with a backslash. (Any character following a backslash is treated as ascii)

**ayjay_t:**  
@issuebot new "teleport" "Support Platform: Atari" "It wonâ€™t compile on Atari due to whatever"  
**issuebot:**  
Success: https://github.com/nlopes/slack/issues/460  

_Or_

**ayjay_t:**  
/msg @issuebot new "issuebot" "Feature Addition" "Need to authenticate with SSO"  
**issuebot:**  
Failure: Network error | No/Bad Repo | etc
